          <blockquote>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>Ratan Tata is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, one of India's largest and oldest conglomerates. He was born on December 28, 1937, in Mumbai, India. Ratan Tata is known for his significant contributions to the growth and diversification of the Tata Group during his tenure as chairman.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.”</blockquote>
